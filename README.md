### ‚ùó Notice
I am not the original creator of MorePlayerModels. The original creator is @[Noppes](https://github.com/Noppes). I have been permitted to update the 1.7.10 and post my results on GitHub. The original mod that is updated to the latest versions of Minecraft can be found on these links: [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-player-models), [kodevelopment](http://www.kodevelopment.nl/minecraft/moreplayermodels/)

### üîπ Installation
This mod is an ***update*** to MorePlayerModels and not an add-on. Do not install MorePlayerModels with MorePlayerModels-Plus. MorePlayerModels-Plus does not remove any functional features from the original mod. It expands upon MorePlayerModels with original features and backported features from newer versions. Simply drag MorePlayerModels-Plus into any client/server mods folder to utilize. Please **backup** before using as this could still have unforeseen errors. Report any bugs if found, thank you and enjoy.
